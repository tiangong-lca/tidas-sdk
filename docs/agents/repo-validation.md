## Default Baseline

Unless the change is doc-only, the canonical verification scripts are:

```bash
./scripts/ci/verify-typescript-package.sh
./scripts/ci/verify-python-package.sh
```

These scripts are the best repo-wide proof because they mirror CI expectations and current upstream-resolution behavior.

## Validation Matrix

| Change type | Minimum local proof | Additional proof when risk is higher | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript package source, examples, or package scripts | `./scripts/ci/verify-typescript-package.sh` | run one focused example or narrow package command when the change is isolated | This verify script covers build, tests, generated artifacts, and packability. |
| Python package source, scripts, or tests | `./scripts/ci/verify-python-package.sh` | run one focused pytest or generation step when the change is isolated | Record if the Python package still depends on generated artifacts from a specific upstream commit. |
| shared generation helpers under `scripts/ci/**` | run both verify scripts | run the matching `generate-*.sh` path if the task explicitly changes refresh behavior | Generation changes can affect both packages even if only one output changed. |
| release setup, tag, or publish workflows | run both verify scripts | inspect `.github/workflows/**` and record any tag or environment assumptions checked locally | Tag creation and registry publication are separate from local package verification. |
| repo contract or governed-doc changes only | `docpact validate-config --root . --strict` and `docpact lint --root . --staged --mode enforce` | run one focused route check such as `docpact route --root . --intent repo-docs --format text` or `upstream-refresh` when the change touches release / automation docs | Refresh review evidence even when prose-only governed docs change. |

## Upstream Resolution Notes

Facts that matter:

- TypeScript and Python generation resolve `tidas-tools` in this order:
  1. `TIDAS_TOOLS_PATH`
  2. sibling `../tidas-tools`
  3. temporary clone
- this means local verification may exercise different upstream content depending on the environment
- if you intentionally validate against a local checkout, record that in the PR note

## Minimum PR Note Quality

A good PR note for this repo should say:

1. which verify scripts ran
2. whether generation used a local `tidas-tools` checkout or the default resolution path
3. whether tag or publish proof is deferred to GitHub Actions
