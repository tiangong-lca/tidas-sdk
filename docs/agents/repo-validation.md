## Default Baseline

Unless the change is doc-only, the canonical verification scripts are:

```bash
./scripts/ci/verify-typescript-package.sh
./scripts/ci/verify-python-package.sh
```

These scripts are the best repo-wide proof because they mirror CI expectations and current upstream-resolution behavior.

## Validation Matrix

| Change type | Minimum local proof | Additional proof when risk is higher | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript package source, examples, or package scripts | `./scripts/ci/verify-typescript-package.sh` | run one focused example or narrow package command when the change is isolated | This verify script covers build, tests, generated artifacts, and packability. When the change touches validation behavior, also record one smoke result that proves the normalized `validationIssues` payload still exposes stable `code`, `path`, `severity`, optional `params`, and `rawCode`. |
| Python package source, scripts, or tests | `./scripts/ci/verify-python-package.sh` | run one focused pytest or generation step when the change is isolated | Record if the Python package still depends on generated artifacts from a specific upstream commit. |
| shared generation helpers under `scripts/ci/**` | run both verify scripts | run the matching `generate-*.sh` path if the task explicitly changes refresh behavior | Generation changes can affect both packages even if only one output changed. |
| release setup, tag, or publish workflows | run both verify scripts | inspect `.github/workflows/**` and record any tag or environment assumptions checked locally | Tag creation and registry publication are separate from local package verification. |
| repo contract or governed-doc changes only | `docpact validate-config --root . --strict` and `docpact lint --root . --staged --mode enforce` | run one focused route check such as `docpact route --root . --intent repo-docs --format text` or `upstream-refresh` when the change touches release / automation docs | Refresh review evidence even when prose-only governed docs change. |

## Upstream Resolution Notes

Facts that matter:

- TypeScript and Python generation resolve `tidas-tools` in this order:
  1. `TIDAS_TOOLS_PATH`
  2. sibling `../tidas-tools`
  3. temporary clone
- this means local verification may exercise different upstream content depending on the environment
- if you intentionally validate against a local checkout, record that in the PR note

## Validation Contract Notes

- TypeScript callers should prefer `validateEnhanced()` and consume the returned `validationIssues` array instead of parsing raw Zod error prose when stable UI or API behavior matters.
- Normalized validation issues should preserve `code`, `path`, `severity`, optional `params`, `message`, and `rawCode`.
- Generated localized-text checks must keep attaching `params.validationCode` so the downstream normalized code resolves to stable values such as `localized_text_zh_must_include_chinese_character` and `localized_text_en_must_not_contain_chinese_character`.
- If a change touches `sdks/typescript/scripts/generate-zod-schemas.ts`, `sdks/typescript/src/core/config/ValidationConfig.ts`, or committed schema output under `sdks/typescript/src/schemas/**`, mention in the PR note whether the validation contract changed or remained backward compatible.

## Minimum PR Note Quality

A good PR note for this repo should say:

1. which verify scripts ran
2. whether generation used a local `tidas-tools` checkout or the default resolution path
3. whether tag or publish proof is deferred to GitHub Actions
