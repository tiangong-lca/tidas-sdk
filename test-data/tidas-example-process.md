## Description

The main data sources used in our study are as follows: 1) Energy consumption and material inputs are obtained from investigations in Tai Lake Watershed; 2) The energy use emission factor is obtained from our own calculation, IPCC, and the literature.3) The fugitive emissions during landfilling, incineration, and composting are mainly determined by the model given in the other study as well as by the IPCC factors (2006), except for the CH4 emission in landfilling, which is obtained from study.4) Data from theoretical calculations (see Incineration section).

## Time Coverage

Reference Year: 2013
The original article does not provide an expiration date, and the publication date of the article is used as the validity period.

## Geography

Tai Lake Watershed

## Technology

The data set describes the aerobic composting process of municipal sludge treatment and disposal within the Tai Lake Watershed area. It applies specifically to scenarios where dry sludge is processed into compost, which can be utilized in agricultural applications to improve soil quality and fertility.

Dewatered sludge is first composted in an organic fertilizer plant, bought by the local government, and then used for urban green spaces as fertilizer and soil.

## Methodology

**Data Set Type:** Unit process, single operation
